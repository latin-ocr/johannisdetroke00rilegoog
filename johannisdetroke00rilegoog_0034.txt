XXX INTRODUOTION.

Collation put the Duke to death (p. 221), 18 unnoticed in Walsing—
ἓξὲξ-ΟΨ 113111 (Ρ. 226) ; together with the threat alleged to have
Walsing: been uttered by Richard‚ that in case of refiisaL Notting-
ξέξέῗὲξ- 113111 himself should be slain. The account too (p. 221) of
1332- ‘th the perpetration of the murder is more circumstantia]
ilie &oxias than that given in Walsingham (p. 226) ; and the same
§3332 as to the particulars of King Richard adding 130 his
No. viis shield the arms of St. Edward the Confessor (p. 223,
MS. (2) Wals. p. 227). The account of the new creations of
EarIS, Marquises‚ and “Dukelings ’' (Dukettvz), as 13110
populace derisively called them, and of 13110 tyranny
and malevolence now openly displayed by the reckless
sovereign‚ with the names of his principal advisers
(pp. 223, 224), 18 11013 found in Walsingham's pages.

AD. 1398.-The proceedings against Sir 1J 01111 de Cob-
ham (p. 224) are not given in Walsingham’s text (p. 227) ;
and there is a similar omission as to the breach of the
promise made to him and the Earl of Warwick by Richard,

and the Isle of Man. The general pardon granted
at the termination of the Parliament held at Shrews-
bury this year (pp. 224, 225), 18 omitted in Walsing-
ham. The circumstances attending the quarrel between
the Dukes of Hereford and Norfolk, the indications of
popular feeling in favour of the Duke of Hereford‚ and
the interference of King Richard to prevent the duel
. (pp. 225, 226), are given with a minuteness that is not to
be found in Walsingham (pp. 227, 228). The alleged
threats of the Sultan Bajazet against the Pope and Oar-
ᾶ111318, the aid given to the Emperor of Constantinople

. by King Richard, in money but not in men, and the pro-
phecy uttered by William Norham, the hermit, with his
imprisonment in the Tower by Richard’s order (pp. 231,

232), are omitted in Walsingham. The same, als0, as to the
