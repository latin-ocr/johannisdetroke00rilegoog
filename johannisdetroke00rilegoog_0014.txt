1274 and lasted for eight-and-twenty years after that

date, or, in other words, down to A.D. 1302. The

end of the life, too, of Edward I. (July 1307) is almost
undoubtedly alluded to in the passage of the Opus (page

Ahanor all the days of his lise3 a fact which addi-
tionally proves that Maryns must have been the Abbot

alluded to, Abbot John de Berkhamsted having died

in November 1301, and no Abbot named “John ”having
succeeded till the election of John Moot (or De la Mote)

as Abbot in 1396. The dates also of the various events
mentioned in the OpuS, as the reader will observe on
reference to the N otes and the outer margine, are re-
peatedly erroneous ; whereas in the so-·called Rishanger’s
Chroniele, though the facts of the Opus have to a eon-
ssiderable extent been made use of, the dates are in

general corrected throughout.
Probatility The result then is, that the Opus and Rishanger's
