{¹0ssss {iffi} AD. 14011- The alleged attempt (pp. 322, 32 ) 1ο

139ξ- ith poison King Hem-y and his eldest son, the Prince of

1ζὲ clulius WaleS, is unnoticed in‘Walsingham. The singularly in-

Christi teresting particulars of the conspiracy, capture, and exe-

ffduffi' cution, by the people of Oirencester, of the Earls of Kent

MS. (2)· and Salisbury‚ are given with much more of detail (pp.

323-326) than in Walsingham’s pages (pp. 243, 244.) The

same remark applies also (pp. 326-329) to the capture

and execution of the Earl of Huntingdon at Pleshy, in

Essex (Wals. p. 245), for complicity in the conspiracy.

In Walsingham, we are merely told (p. 245) that 13116 de-

he found himself unable to swallow it3 the orifice

of the gullet (orificio stomachi), the writer says,

having become closed through long abstinence. The

circumstances, als0, (p. 331) attending 13116 conveyance

of his body from Pontefract 130 London are incorrectly

related in Walsingham (p. 246) in some particulars3

and the important fact is there altogether suppressed,

that when it was ostensibly shown 130 13116 public (for

the purpose of identification), at the various places 011

13116 road at which it rested for the night, the face was

exposed only from the ‘lowest part of the forehead to

the throat (ab ima parte frontis usque ad 91116111,

p. 331)-a mode of shewing it* anything but likely

to ensure a really satisfactory recognition. Such being

the case, to some at least the question will suggest

itself, whether this really was the body of Richard, or
