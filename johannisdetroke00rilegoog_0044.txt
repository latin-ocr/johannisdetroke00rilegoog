’ consternation of the Mayor 011 discovering that he is in
rebellion against the King (pp. 411, 412), are omit-ted

in Walsingham3 though his pages (271) contain some

factS, as to the siege of Berwick Oastle, which are not

to be found in the present text. The passage— ‘⁶ Venit

“ erqo W2390m23am-23n proximo habiturum” (pp. 414,

415), is evidently a repetition of matter belonging to a

prior year (1403), the dispute between the Archbishop

of Canterbury and certain knights at 2 Worcester‚ when
proposing the spoliation of the clergy. This repetition,
however, has been avoided in Walsingham. The accu-

sation of fifty-nine Abbots and Priors of England by a

thies, a sawyer by trade, and the detection of 1116 false-

. hoods by Sir W. Ookayn, the Justiciar (pp. 415, 416),

with the extortion of a subsidy for the Papal Nuncios

(p. 417), are unnoticed in Walsingham. ”

AD. 1406.-The combat between the English and the
Welch on St. George’s Day, and the death of a son of

Owen Glendower (p. 418), are omitted in Walsingham3 as

aISO, the new grant made by the clergy to the King3 (p.

418) 3 the dismissal of thejssretons of the Queen's house-

hold, with her two daughters by her former marriage 3

the eclipse of the sun this year ; and the seizure of wines
