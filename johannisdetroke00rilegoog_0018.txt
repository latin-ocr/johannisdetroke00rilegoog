Collation Chronicle (pp. 67, 63). The same, 100, with the account
ssgnssffissm' of Edward being wounded at Aere by an assassin

anger’s 16 1116 hand3 while agam, no 16661106 16 made 1n the

chroniele. Chronicle of the mode adopted of stanching the flow of
blood, by the application of precious stones, as alleged
in the Opus (p. 30). The somewhat full account (p. 31)
of Edward's reasons for not taking vengeance on the
Saracens is abridged in the Chronicle (pp. 70, 71). 'The
account of the death of Henry 111„ and particulare as to
his wife and children, as given in the Opus, are trans-
ferred to Rishanger's Chronicle, and have thence found
their way (through MS. Reg. 13 E. ix.) to the pages of
Walsingham. 'The ¹ same, 100, 66 10 the character of
Henry depicted in the Opus (pp. 35‚..36); a character,
marked by an attention to religione formalities‚ which
might have been an indication of really conscientious
feeling in a good man, but which could have been
nothing but a debased superstition in a person so utterly
destitute of principle as he repeatedly proved himself to
be. The account, again, of Henry’s last momente and
death (p. 36) is closely copied in Rishanger’s chronioie
(pp. 73, 74), and from thence (through MS. Reg. 13 Ε. ixa,
previously mentioned,) into the pages of Walsingham3
ῃ but, whereas the Opus says (p. 36) that Henry received
the Eucharist in both kinds—-“ corpus 61 sanyuine‘m
“ devote suscepit,”·-—the compiler of the Chronicle, in a
spirit perhaps of more rigid orthodoxy, has omitted all
mention of the latter,--“ demde devote suscepit corpus
“ Christi '' (p. 74) being the words of his text. ,.
