Of Henry de Blaneforde‚ monk of St. Alban' S, the No othing

writer of this brief and mutilated Chroniele, nothing ,ἐξ {unz
beyond the name, given at the beginning of his work,

appears to be known. The Chroniele is mentioned in

¹ Walsingham (from MS. Reg. 13 Ε. ix.) as that of

Henry “ Blankforde,'' while by otherS, again, of the old

writers, he is called “ Blancfront.'' In the Liber Bene-
faotorum (p. 448 of 131115 Volume), a Walter Blanofront is
mentioned, as having given (at sorno unreoorded date)

the chureh of Potesgrave to the Abbey of St. Alban' 5.

native of, or through his family derived his origin

from, ¹that place, which then belonged 130 13110 English

Hem-ne, and (through MS. Reg. 13 E. ix.) the greater

part of its matter has been transferred to the pages of
