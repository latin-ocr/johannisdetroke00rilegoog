The narrative of the destruction of Norwich Cathedral
by fire (A.D. 1272), as given in Rishanger's Chronicle
(pp. 73, 74), appears to have be'en partly borrowed from
the Opus (p. 28); with an addition, however, as to the
employment of Sir Thomas Trivet, as Justician in the

tion derived either from the Annales of N icholas Trivet,
the Dominican, who was a son of the Justiciar, or from
his sources. But whereas the text of the Opus informs
us (p. 28) that some of those convicted were hanged‚
while some were condemned to be drawn by horseS,
and others to be burnt, these horrible details are cor-

Chronicle, which merely stat-es that many were con-
demned to be drawn at horses’ tails and hanged. So,

Prince Edward's resolution, on hearing of these dis-
asters (p. 29), to enter Aere, even if accompanied solely
by Fowin, his palfreyman, is closely copied in the

that the Opus (like, perhapS, most of ments thus coming down to future
the early mediaeval Chronieles) was hands in an uncorreeted state.
