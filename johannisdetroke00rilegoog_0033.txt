are omitted altogether in Walsingham. Again, the iiggiwith
account of the annulment of the charters of pat-don, the corpus
of the cowardice shown by the prelates in reference ἓξῖιῗῐῗὲ
thereto, and of the submission of ‘all the prelates, with No. vii.'
one exception, to the King's dictation (pp. 210, 213), is MS. (2)-
curtailed in Walsingham’s text ([12241) into a notice
of thirteen lines only. The circumstantial and interest—-

inflicted upon him by Richard’s Chester men, just

(p. 226) ; while the hypocritical tears of King Richard,
the Duke of Lancaster, and others present on the
occasion, pass without notice. The same, als0, with the
interrogat-‚ories administered to the Duke ‘of Gloucester
